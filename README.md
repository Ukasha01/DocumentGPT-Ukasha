# 📚 Document GPT – AI Chatbot for Your Documents

**Developed by Muhammad Ukasha Ghufran**

This AI-powered chatbot can read documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and answer questions based on their content.  
It uses:

- 🧠 **Google Gemini Pro** – for answering and main brain
- 📦 **LlamaIndex** – for document parsing and all framework
- 🧬 **HuggingFace Embeddings**
- 💾 **ChromaDB** – for vector embedding storage
- ✅ Query answers using Google Gemini (1.5 Flash) LLM  
- 🌐 **Gradio** – web-based chat interface

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Upload any document
2. It extracts & stores its text using embeddings
3. Ask any question – it answers using LLM based on only that document
